                <P>It is a Line Maze Solving Robot used to find the shortest path in a maze.
                    The proposed algorithm, called Short Path Finder Algorithm, which consists of three modes, is
                    implemented to the robot. Those modes are the search mode; the short path mode; and the return and
                    path mode.
